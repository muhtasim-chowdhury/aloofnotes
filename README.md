# aloofnotes
This is a note taking application inspired by Google Keep. It contains both the client and server applications. The client application was made with Create-React-App and is served by Express and Github Pages. The backend application is hosted on Heroku and acts as an API to create, read, update or delete notes. It can also serve the client application files. To run locally the project requries the environment variable MONGO_URI.Heroku's free service shuts down the API server after 30 minutes. Please wait patiently if you want to demo the app. Hosted on the following:
